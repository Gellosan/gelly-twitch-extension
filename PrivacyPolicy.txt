Gelly Twitch Extension — Privacy Policy

Effective date: 2025-12-18

We respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what we collect, how we use it, and your choices when you use the Gelly Twitch extension (the "Extension").

If you do not agree, please do not use the Extension.

1) Who we are

Controller/Publisher: twitch.tv/gellosan
Contact: gellobluefalcon@gmail.com

2) What we collect

A. Twitch identifiers & profile data

Opaque ID (always available in Twitch Extensions).

Numeric Twitch User ID and login/display name when you grant identity sharing.

JWT claims provided by Twitch (role, channel info), verified server‑side.

B. Gameplay & device events

Gelly state (stage, color, stats), inventory, leaderboards.

Interaction events (feed/play/clean/color), cooldowns.

Bits transactions metadata as returned by Twitch verification (transaction id, product SKU).

WebSocket session status and limited technical logs (timestamps, error codes).

We do not collect precise location or contact lists.

C. Third‑party balances

StreamElements username and points for in‑extension economy ("Jellybeans"). We request point totals via StreamElements APIs or chat bot commands.

D. Network data

IP address and user agent may be processed transiently by our hosting/CDN for security and delivery. We do not attempt to fingerprint users.

3) How we use data

Provide, operate, and secure the Extension (state sync, inventory, leaderboards).

Verify Bits purchases with Twitch and deliver virtual items.

Retrieve/adjust loyalty point balances with StreamElements for in‑game actions.

Prevent fraud, abuse, and enforce cooldowns/rate limits.

Debug performance and reliability.

Comply with legal obligations and Twitch policies.

4) Legal bases (EEA/UK only)

If you are in the EEA/UK, we process data based on:

Performance of a contract (operate the Extension you request).

Legitimate interests (fraud prevention, security, analytics limited to reliability).

Consent (Twitch identity sharing; optional features). You can revoke identity sharing in Twitch.

5) Sharing

We share data only with:

Twitch (including OAuth, Extensions, and Bits verification APIs).

StreamElements (loyalty points).

Hosting & infrastructure providers (e.g., Render/Heroku/Vercel, MongoDB Atlas, logging/metrics).

Service providers under contract (only as needed to provide the Extension).

Law enforcement when required by law.

We do not sell your personal information.

6) Retention

Gameplay state & inventory: kept while your Extension usage is active and for up to {{12}} months of inactivity (for recovery), unless you request deletion.

Logs: typically {{30–90}} days, unless needed to investigate abuse/security.

Bits transaction ids: retained for chargeback/fraud resolution for {{12–24}} months.

7) Security

We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational measures (HTTPS/TLS, token verification, RBAC, least‑privilege). No system is 100% secure. Report issues to {{security@yourdomain}}.

8) Your rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or export your data.

EEA/UK: GDPR rights; contact us to exercise.

California: CCPA/CPRA rights; we do not sell/share personal info for cross‑context behavioral advertising.

To exercise rights, email {{privacy@yourdomain}} from the email linked to your Twitch account (if any) or provide your Twitch User ID.

9) Children

The Extension is intended for users 13+ and follows Twitch’s minimum age policy. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If you believe a child provided data, contact us to delete it.

10) International transfers

We may process data in countries outside your own. Where required, we use safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses.

11) Changes

We may update this Policy from time to time. Material changes will be signposted in the Extension or via the published date above.
